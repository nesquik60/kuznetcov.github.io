          · Make sure your objectives are clear. This will help you to prepare material that is interesting and informative. Remember, you want your audience to learn something they don’t know. You also want them to enjoy your presentation.<br>

          · There are many different kinds of audio-visual aids. You can use a simple flip chart or show slides on an overhead projector. There is also computer software which can make your presentation look professional. Choose AV aids that are appropriate for your audience. And make sure you know how they work.<br>
          
          · It’s important to know your audience. How many people are there? Where are they from? What do they want to learn? How much do they already know?<br>
          
          · Make notes of the most important points. Make sure you speak to your audience – don’t read to them. Practise giving your talk out loud and check how much time it takes. Ask a friend to listen and give you feedback.<br>
          
          · A well-organizes presentation is easier to understand. Give it a beginning, a middle and a end. Make separate points and number them. This structure will help your audience to follow what you are saying.<br>
          
          · The venue is important too. If possible, visit it before your presentation. Where will the audience sit? Where will you stand? Where will you put your equipment?<br>
