          Advantages and warning<br /><br />

          The great danger (in using visual aids) is that presenters place the major emphasis
          on visual aid and relegate themselves to the minor role of narrator or technician.
          You are central to the presentation. The visual aids need you, your interpretation,
          your explanation, your conviction and your justification. Visual aids can make
          information more memorable and they help the speaker. However, they must literally
          support what the speaker says and not simply replace the spoken information. It is
          also not enough to just read the text from a visual aid.<br /><br />

          There are many advantages to the correct use of visual aids. They can show
          information which is not easily expressed in words or they can highlight information.
          They cause the audience to employ another sense to receive information, they bring
          variety and therefore increase the audience's attention. They save time and they
          clarify complex information.
