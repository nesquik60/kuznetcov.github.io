          I believe that the whole presentation should be of high quality. For this, all
          possible methods must be applied. I think that it is necessary to pay attention to
          every point of the presentation.<br /><br />

          I can say several main things in my opinion:<br />

          1) good preparation on the subject<br />

          2) repetition of material before presentation<br />

          3) equipment check<br />

          4) talk more than read<br />

          5) use visual support<br />

          6) and of course a clear structure<br /><br />

          But we must not forget about all the other rules of a good presentation.
