          Traditional and new ways of banking services
        </h1>
        <p>
          Traditional banking services imply having an account for writing cheques, paying by
          debit card and paying bills at local branches of banks. Such account can be joint
          (client of a bank can use it collectively with other people he/she trusts). Client is
          in the black whether he/she spends only the amount of money he/she possesses; the
          case when he/she spends more money, that he/she has means he/she goes into the red,
          it is also called overdraft, which must be agreed with the bank and requires to pay
          interest rate.<br /><br />

          Deposit or saving accounts are another one type of account which is possible to hold,
          their main aim is to keep money for a long term and earn interest. Credit or debit
          plastic cards are available as well. It is important to pay off every month not to
          pay high interest. Mortgages also are widely practiced.<br /><br />

          New ways of banking are telephone banking (client can check his/her account balance,
          transfer money to other accounts and pay bills by calling to bank), internet banking
          (client manages his/her account sitting at his/her computer at home or everywhere
          he/she wants) and mobile banking (client manages his/her account via special
          application on mobile phone).
