        <h1>Why money makes the world go around?</h1>
        <p>
          Money is an essential thing for people, because they perform many important
          functions. Firstly, money is a medium of exchange â€” that is something people will
          accept for their goods or services. The second use of money is that it serves as a
          unit of account. People state the price of goods and services in terms of money. In
          the United States, people use dollars to specify price, just as they use hours to
          express time and miles or kilometers to measure distance. The third use of money is
          as a store of wealth. People can save money and then use it to make purchases in the
          future. Money is nearly the main option for people to communicate: they work for
          money, they go out to spend money, they sometimes make friends for money, they love,
          live and die for money.
