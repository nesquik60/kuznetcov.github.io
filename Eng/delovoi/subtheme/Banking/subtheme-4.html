          Early forms of money
        </h1>
        <p>
          Money is anything that is generally accepted by people in exchange for the things
          they sell or the work they do. Gold and silver were once the most common forms of
          money. For example, before paper and coins were introduced as permanent forms of
          paying, people used a variety of other objects to serve as money for selling
          goods.<br /><br />

          Examples of early forms of money are the fallowing: rice (China), dogs teeth (Papua
          New Guinea), small tools (China), quartz 'pebbles (Ghana), gambling counters (Hong
          Kong), shells (India). Metal disks (first forms of money, Tibet), and quite a number
          of others. However, today money consists mainly of paper bills, coins made of various
          metals, and checking account deposits.
