          Each country has its own basic unit of money. In the United States, for example, the
          basic unit is the US dollar. Canada uses the Canadian dollar. France the franc, Great
          Britain the pound sterling, and Russia the rouble. The money in use in a country is
          called currency.<br /><br />

          Money in general, has three main uses. The first and most important is a medium of
          exchange â€” that is, something people will accept for their goods or services. Without
          a medium of exchange people would have to trade their goods or services directly for
          other goods or services.<br /><br />
          
          The second use of money is that it serves as a unit of account. People state the
          price of goods and services in terms of money.<br><br>

          The third use of money is as a store of wealth. People can save money and then use it
          to make purchases in the future. Other stores of wealth include gold, jewels,
          paintings, real estate, stocks and bonds.
