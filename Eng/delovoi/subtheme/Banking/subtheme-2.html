          History of banks
        </h1>
        <p>
          Speaking about banks and money we can’t help mentioning the city of Amsterdam. In
          1609 the merchants created a bank owned by the city. A merchant brought his good and
          wretched coins to the bank, the bank weighed them. The weight of the pure metal was
          then credited to his account.<br /><br />

          This deposit was a very reliable form of money. A merchant could transfer it to the
          account of another merchant. The recipient knew that he was getting honest weight,
          nothing funny.<br /><br />

          Then came the second Amsterdam discovery. The deposits did not need to be left idle
          in the bank. They could be lent. The Bank then got interest. The borrower then had a
          deposit that he could spend.<br /><br />

          The important thing is that the original depositor and the borrower must never come
          at the same time for their deposits. A lot of money was borrowed by the Dutch East
          India Company. In the 18th century the loans went into default. The depositors
          started coming and they couldn’t be paid.<br /><br />

          In 1716 in Paris John Law sold an idea for a new kind of bank. The deposits of it
          would be secured by land rather than by silver and gold. Thus the Bank Royal was
          established.<br /><br />

          In 1694 the Bank of England was formed. The Bank regulated the creation of money. The
          Bank maintained reasonable reserves of cash against their note issues. Later the Bank
          acquired a monopoly of note issue throughout the country. The customers of the
          commercial banks transferred gold and silver from the ordinary banks to the Bank of
          England. The commercial banks could replace their depleted reserves by borrowing from
          the Bank of England. But the Bank could raise the rate of interest, that is the Bank
          Rate (or the discount rate). So the Bank of England had the regulatory functions.<br /><br />

          Coinage was the invention of the Greeks. We come now to paper money. They came from
          America. It was Benjamin Franklin who first printed money for the colonial
          governments on his own printing press. The Quebec model of money was the playing card
          as most readily available and durable stock. The official government signature was
          simply attached to it. The cards were redeemed in gold and silver.<br /><br />

          Have you ever heard of “coins” so heavy that it takes several men to carry them? It’s
          too surprising but you’ll find such coins on the Island of Yap, in the East Pacific
          Islands. They are made of stones with the hole in the center. The natives still use
          them as money.<br /><br />

          These coins are probably the heaviest and the biggest known. The lightest and the
          smallest were the gold coins used in Southern India at the beginning of the last
          century. They were “pin-head” size.
