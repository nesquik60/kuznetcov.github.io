        <h1>The bank account you prefer</h1>
        <p>
          I prefer to have mobile account, because as to me this way of banking is the most
          convenient, I can transfer money, pay bills and check my account wherever and
          whenever I want within a couple of minutes via my phone. Also, I hate going to banks
          due to long queues and often impolite staff, so this option is perfect for me.
