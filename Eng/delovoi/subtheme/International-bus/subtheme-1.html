          Difinition of managment
        </h1>
        <p>
          There is no single approach to defining such concept as management. There exists the
          debatable question whether management is an art or a science. The majority of people
          use both. Shortly, management can be defined as skilful treatment the business or
          enterprise. The collective meaning of the word management is "the persons who are in
          charge of a business", which is equal to the Board of Directors. So, management
          implies the personnel who have the right to make decisions which regulate company's
          affairs. As a rule, Board of Directors manages the limited liability company or joint
          stock company. They are elected by the shareholders and are responsible for control
          of the company. The directors, in their turn, elect the managing director or general
          manager. The managing director is in charge of everyday running the company and his
          duty is to coordinate the work of various department managers: Sales Manager,
          Personnel Manager, Chief Buyer, Chief Accountant and others. <br />
