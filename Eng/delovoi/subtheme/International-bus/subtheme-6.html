        <p>
          Before, leaders were distant and remote, not easy to get to know or communicate with.
          Today, managers are more open and approachable: you can talk to them easily. There is
          more management by consensus, where decisions are not imposed from above in a
          top-down approach, but arrived at by asking employees to contribute in a process of
          consultation.
