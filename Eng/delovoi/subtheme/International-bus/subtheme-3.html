        </h1>

          Traditionally, the model for leadership in business has been the army. Managers and
          army officers give orders and their subordinates (the people working below them)
          carry them out. Managers, like army officers, may be sent on leadership courses to
          develop their leadership skills, their ability to lead. But they still need a basic
          flair or talent for leadership.<br /><br />

          The greatest leaders have charisma, an attractive quality that makes other people
          admire them and want to follow them. A leader may be described as a visionary,
          someone with the power to see clearly how things are going to be in the future.
          People often say leaders have drive, dynamism and energy.<br /><br />

          There are more women managers now, who are often more able to build consensus than
          traditional military-style authoritarian male managers.<br /><br />

          Encouraging employees to use their own initiative, to take decisions on their own
          without asking managers first, is empowerment. Decision-making becomes more
          decentralized and less bureaucratic, less dependent on managers and systems. This is
          often necessary where the number of management levels is reduced.<br /><br />

          To empower employees, managers need the ability to delegate, to give other people
          responsibility for work rather than doing it all themselves. Of course, with
          empowerment and delegation, the problem is keeping control of your operations: a key
          issue of modern management.<br /><br />

          In most business schools now six fundamental managerial skills are taught: creative
          insight, sensitivity, vision, versatility, focus, patience in order to reach the
          following tasks:<br />

          – to set goals and to establish policies and procedures;<br />

          – to organize, motivate, and control people;<br />

          – to analyse situations and to formulate strategic and operating plans;<br />

          – to react to changes bringing new strategies into reality;<br />

          – to produce significant growth, profitability and return on investment.<br />
