        <p>
          The characteristics of management often vary according to national culture, which can
          determine how managers are trained, how they lead people and how they approach their
          jobs.<br /><br />

          The amount of responsibility of any individual in a company depends on the position
          that he or she occupies in its hierarchy. Managers, for example, are responsible for
          leading the people directly under them, who are called subordinates. To do this
          successfully, they must use their authority, which is the right to take decisions and
          give orders. Managers often delegate authority. This means that employees at lower
          levels in the company hierarchy can use their initiative, that is make decisions
          without asking their manager.<br /><br />

          The dos and don'ts of travelling abroad are a potential minefield for the unprepared
          traveller. If you spit in some countries, you could end up in prison. In others,
          spitting is a competitive sport.<br /><br />

          Do<br />

          * Show an interest in, and at least an elementary knowledge of the country you are
          visiting;<br />

          * Learn a few words of the language â€” it will be seen as a compliment;<br />

          * Be sensitive to countries who have bigger and better-known neighbours, and try not
          to confuse Canadians with Americans, New Zealanders with Australians, Belgians with
          French;<br />

          * Familiarise yourself with the basics of business and social etiquette. As a
          starting point, learning how to greet people is very important.<br /><br />

          Don't<br />

          * Assume you won't meet any communication problems because you speak English. You may
          think you are paying somebody a compliment by telling them their business is going a
          bomb, Americans will infer you think it is failing.<br />

          * Appear too reserved. As Americans are generally more exuberant than their European
          colleagues, they may equate reserve with lack of enthusiasm.
