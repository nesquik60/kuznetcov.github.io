          Retailing is the provision of goods and services to the customer. Retailers buy goods
          directly from the manufacturer of from wholesaler (the “middleman”), and make their
          income from the margin, or difference, between the price they pay for the goods and
          the price they sell the goods at to the consumer. A retail outlet is the place where
          customers can purchase goods, for example, a supermarket or a department store.
          Nowadays, many customers are shopping from home: shopping by the Internet, TV
          shopping channels or mail-order catalogues is becoming very popular.
