          What is important for you when you shop.

        <p>
          1) Price. I would like to use reasonable money on right things<br />

          2) Comfortable. Never buy a slightly bigger size so that you can grow into it or a
          smaller size as you can squeeze yourself into it<br /><br />

          3) Occasion. Whether I am buying if for a specific purpose or is it just casual
          shopping<br /><br />

          4) Colors. I donâ€™t like when look is dull or too colorful. Everything should be in
          moderation
