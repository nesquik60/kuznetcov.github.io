          a) International trade is the exchange of goods and services between different countries. Depending on what country produces and needs it can export and import.<br><br>

          Import – bring in goods from another country. Export – send goods to another country.<br><br>
          
          Governments can control international trade. The most common measures are tariffs (or duties) and quotas. A tariff is a tax on imported goods, and a quota is the maximum quantity of a product allowed into a country during a certain period of time. These measures are protectionist as they raise price of imported goods to “protect” domestically goods.<br><br>
          
          Companies can choose from various methods to establish their products in a foreign market. One option is to start by working with local experts such a sole agents or multi-distributors , who have a specialist knowledge of the market and behalf of the company.<br><br>
          
          b) Wholesaling is the part of marketing business. It provides channels of distribution which help to bring products to the market. Generally indirect channels are used to market manufactured consumer goods. It could be from the manufacturer to wholesaler, from the retailer to the consumer or though more complicated channels. A direct channel moves goods from the manufacturer or producer to the consumer.<br><br>

          c) Retailing is selling goods and services to the ultimate consumer. The retailers operate through stores, mail-order houses, vending machine operates. There are departments stores, discount houses, cooperatives, single line retailers.<br><br>
