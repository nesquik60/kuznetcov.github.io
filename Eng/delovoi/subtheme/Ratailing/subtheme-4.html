        <p>
          A distribution channel is a chain of businesses or intermediaries through which a
          good or service passes until it reaches the final buyer or the end consumer.<br /><br />
          Channels normally vary from two-level channels without intermediaries to five-level
          channels with three intermediaries.<br /><br />

          For example, a leather handbag manufacturer who prepares handbags and sells it
          directly to the customer is in a two-level channel. A poultry farmer sells chicken
          and eggs to a restaurant supplier, who sells to individual restaurants, who then
          serve the customer, is in a four-level channel. Agents/intermediaries in the channel
          of distribution are used to facilitate the delivery of the merchandise as well as to
          transfer title, payments, and information about the merchandise. A channel performs
          three important functions. Not all channel members perform the same function. The
          functions are:<br />

          • Transactional functions: buying, selling, and risk assumption<br />

          • Logistical functions: assembly, storage, sorting, and transportation<br />

          • Facilitating functions: post-purchase service and maintenance, financing,
          information dissemination, and channel coordination or leadership<br /><br />

          These functions are necessary for the effective flow of product and title to the
          customer and payment back to the producer.
