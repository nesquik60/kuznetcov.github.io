What is business and types
        </h1>
        <p>
          Business is the activity of production, buying and selling goods and providing services. Types of business: the sole trader, the partnership, private limited company(ltd), public limited company (plc). Many large businesses in the UK are public limited companies (plc), which means that the public can buy and sell their shares on the stock exchange. The minimum share capital for a public limited company is Â£50000, so many new businesses are likely to take one of the following forms.<br><br>

          Sole trader or Sole Proprietor (UK) is the simplest way of starting a business. An entrepreneur is self-employed and entirely responsible for all aspects of the management of his or her business.<br><br>
          
          Another form of business is a partnership when two or more people starting a business together. All partners are responsible for the debts of the partnership, and the profits and losses are shared between them.<br><br>
          
          Private Limited Company can be formed with a minimum of two people becoming its shareholders. They must appoint a director and a company secretary. If the company goes out of the business, the responsibility of each shareholder is limited to the amount that they have contributed; they have limited liability. Such a company has Ltd (Limited) after its name.<br><br>
          
          In the US businesses take the same basic forms. However American companies are registered or incorporated with the authorities in the state where they have their headquarters. The abbreviations Inc and Corp refer to such companies. To sell shares to the public they must apply to the Securities Exchange Commission.
