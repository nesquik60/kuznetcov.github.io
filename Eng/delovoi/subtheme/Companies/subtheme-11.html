          I want to work for Apple. Apple is all about Innovation. Due to constant changing of
          customer requirements, Apple ensured that the organization is able to adapt based on
          the current customer requirements hence, they evolutionize and innovate their
          products. I want to join Apple because I want to be a part of something great. I want
          to be a part of an organization that does great things for people not only in terms
          of technology but in terms of connecting with people.
