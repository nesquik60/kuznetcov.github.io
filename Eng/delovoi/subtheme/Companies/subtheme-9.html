          A business sector is a multitude of activities for a specific business. The list of
          sectors is determined by the field in which the company operates which products it
          produces. The list of organization sectors includes: Manufacturing, food retailing,
          real estate and agriculture, other sectors. This is the sector of the company Edizone
          holding. Also, I can use Sony as an example. The business sectors of this company
          include: electronics, games, music, pictures, insurance, and others.
