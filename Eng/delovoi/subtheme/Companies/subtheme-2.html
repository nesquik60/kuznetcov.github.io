          Company is a business organization that sells goods or services to customers.
          Companies are involved in many activities, for example buying, selling, marketing and
          production, in a range of different industries, such as information technology,
          telecommunications, film and car manufacture.<br /><br />

          Many well-known companies are multinationals, these are companies which operate in a
          number of countries. Multinationals often have a complicated structure. There is
          usually a parent or holding company. This company owns other companies or parts of
          other companies. These other companies are called subsidiaries.
