          Companies often include details about their history in their marketing literature,
          their annual reports and company presentation, in order to show that they are
          established, and have experience in their field. This can include information about
          the founder or person who started the company, and key dates and events in the
          company history. In addition, the history of the company indicates exactly what the
          organization is currently engaged in.
