          People who are interested can then apply for the job by sending in a letter op
          application or covering letter and a curriculum vitae or CV (resume) containing
          details of their education and experience. A company may also ask candidates to
          complete a standard application form.<br /><br />

          The Curriculum Vitae contains some points. There are information about education,
          personal details, professional experience, skills, activities and references in the
          CV. In the each point you should give information about your person in short form.<br /><br />

          The letter of application can be as important as the CV in that is often provides the
          first direct contact between a candidate and an employer. If this letter is nor well
          written and presented, it will make a poor impression. The letter of application
          normally contains four paragraphs in which you should:<br />

          路 Confirm that you wish to apply and say where you learned about the job;<br />

          路 Say why you are interested in the position and relate your interests to those of
          the company;<br />

          路 Show that you can contribute to the job by highlighting your most relevant skills
          and experience;<br />

          路 Indicate your willingness to attend an interview (and possibly say when you would
          be free to attend).
