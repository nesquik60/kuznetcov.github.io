          Ways to hire people: direct, indirect
        </h1>
        <p>
          When company needs to recruit or employ new people, it may decide to advertise the
          job or position in the appointments section of a newspaper or special website. People
          who are interested can then apply for the job by sending in a letter op application
          or covering letter and a curriculum vitae or CV (resume) containing details of their
          education and experience. A company may also ask candidates to complete a standard
          application form. The company`s Human Resources department will then select the most
          suitable applications and prepare a short list of candidates or applicants, who are
          invited to attend an interview. Another way for a company to hire is by using the
          services of a recruitment agency (search firm) who will provide them with a list of
          suitable candidates.<br /><br />

          Headhunters or executive search firms specialize in finding the right person for the
          right job. When company wishes to recruit a new person for an important position it
          may use the services of such a firm. The advantages for the employer are that it
          doesn`t have to organize the costly and time-consuming process of advertising,
          selecting and interviewing suitable candidates. In some cases, the search firm may
          already have a list of people with the appropriate skills for the job. If this is not
          the case, then it may act as a consultant, advising on or even organizing testing and
          simulations to evaluate the candidates behavior in order to select the most competent
          and suitable person for the job.
