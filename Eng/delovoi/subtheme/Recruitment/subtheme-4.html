Methods to recruit people: old, new
        </h1>
        <p>
          When company needs to recruit or employ new people, it may decide to advertise the job or position in the appointments section of a newspaper or special website. Another way for a company to hire is by using the services of a recruitment agency (search firm) who will provide them with a list of suitable candidates.<br><br>

          Old: there are traditional job interviews. Candidates could win a top job with the right look and the right answers to questions such as “Why do you want this job?”. Employers looked for experience and professional skills. Some employers hired people they liked, rather then the most competent person.<br><br>
          
          New: employers are requiring applicants to submit to a series of paper-and-pencil tests, role-playing exercises, simulated decision-making exercises and brainteasers. Others put candidates through a long series of interviewing by psychologists or trained interviewers. Employers want to evaluate candidates on intangible qualities: Is she creative and entrepreneurial? Can he lead and coach? Is he flexible and capable of learning? Does she nave passion and a sense of urgency? How will he function under pressure? Will the potential recruit fit the corporate culture?<br><br>
          
          Many employers do background checks, for example, looking for signs of drug use, violence or sexual harassment. But the more comprehensive testing aims to measure skills in communications, analysis and organization, attention to detail and management style; personality traits and motivations that behavioral scientists say predict performance.
