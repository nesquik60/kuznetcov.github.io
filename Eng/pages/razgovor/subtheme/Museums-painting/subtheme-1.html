        <h1>Museums in your city (British museums)</h1>
        <p>
          Actually, these days going to the museums is becoming less and less popular. Some
          people believe that in the digital age museums are still important, whereas others
          think that the modern world does not need museums anymore. Personally, I believe that
          museums play a big role in our life. The most famous museums in Omsk. <br /><br>

          <em>Museum of Fine Arts.</em> Its collection contains over 25,000 items, the most part of
