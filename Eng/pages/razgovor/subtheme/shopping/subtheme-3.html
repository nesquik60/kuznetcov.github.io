        <p>
          <span>Advertising and Promotion</span><br />

          The first step to increasing grocery stores sales is getting consumers to come in.
          Major chains use regular, weekly advertising newspaper inserts that showcase
          specials.<br /><br />

          <span>In-Store Coupons</span><br />

          Place coupons on shelving in the aisles of your store to get consumers to notice
          particular foods they might not have come to buy. Put coupon sheets with multiple
          coupons at the front of the store near shopping carts to encourage customers to look
          for certain items. If you have a store loyalty program, allow customers to load
          electronic coupons directly to their card or app. Another option is to offer
          printable coupons online.<br /><br />

          <span>Use Larger Cart</span><br />

          A cart with space in it sends a subliminal message to many shoppers that they have
          not exhausted their budget and have more money to spend.<br /><br />

          <span>Offer Free Samples</span><br />

          If you are selling a new product, offer free samples using displays near the items.
          Display a new cheese with a popular cracker, or chunks of your homemade bread with a
          vegetable dip.
