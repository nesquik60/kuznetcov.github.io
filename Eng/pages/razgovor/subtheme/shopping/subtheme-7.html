          Clothes have not always been as influential a 'tell' of our personalities as they are
          today. Only as a result of technical advancements over centuries have fashion choices
          become significant.<br /><br />

          Where in early civilizations, the key purpose of clothing was to keep us warm and
          relatively dry, today, central heating warms our homes, reducing our dependence on
          clothes alone to help us to survive. Clothes have developed from a practical asset to
          a social marker: they affect the way we see ourselves. They help us to be seen in the
          light that we wish to be, and also exude our personalities and social status.<br /><br />

          In many societies, dress sense embodies personal wealth and taste. For example,
          Economist George Taylor demonstrated this most vividly with the Hemline Index
          (Taylor, 1926).4 Taylor noted that as a country enters recession and adopts austere
          spending habits, women often show a preference towards longer dresses, whilst during
          times of prosperity, the opposite result can be seen - hemlines often become
          shorter.<br /><br />

          A second key influence on our dress sense is a result of millions of years of
          development as a species. As with many animals, the concept of mate selection in
          evolutionary psychology suggests that our behavior is determined by our efforts to
          find a mate and to reproduce.<br /><br />

          Signalling in animals: 'honest signals' such as this male peacock displaying his
          colorful covert feathers to attract a female partner.<br /><br />

          According to signalling theory, a male peacock will display his vibrant fan of covert
          feathers in a ritual to attract a female with whom to mate. Such rituals vary from
          species to species, but in humans, our ability to create and wear clothes gives us a
          equivalent advantage in being able to distinguish ourselves from a crowd and
          demonstrate our individuality in an effort to find a mate. Conversely, too, we might
          use clothing to merge into a crowd and hide our individuality by dressing in a
          uniform.
