          <span>Advantages:</span><br />

          <span>• It is easy to compare prices. </span><br />
          Multiple websites often sell the same product. hanks to the internet, both stores can
          have their websites pulled up in a separate tab so that the prices can be instantly
          compared.<br /><br />

          <span>• Customers have more access to a variety of products. </span><br />
          There are no local restrictions in place when shopping online. Consumers can shop
          globally for the goods or services that they want or need<br /><br />

          <span> • There are no checkout lines to worry about. </span><br />
          Shopping online is simple and easy. Just add the wanted goods or services to the
          shopping cart on that website and then checkout when ready.<br /><br />

          <span>• Products sold online are often cheaper than those sold in stores.</span>
          <br />
          To encourage online shopping, many stores offer discounts on products purchased
          online compared to products purchased in their stores.<br /><br /><br />

          <span>Disatvantages:</span><br />

          <span>• Products can’t be tried before they are purchased. </span><br />
          If someone is unsure of how much value a product may have, there is no way to relieve
          that concern when shopping online. Clothes or shoes cannot be tried on. Electronics
          cannot be verified until they are received. That means there is a certain risk to an
          online purchase, even if the product description is accurate.<br /><br />

          <span>• There may be shipping costs or delays. </span><br />
          Many websites offer free shipping, but only if the order meets a purchasing
          threshold, such as $75. Other sites charge a flat shipping fee for every order, no
          matter what.<br /><br />

          <span>• There is no guarantee of delivery. </span><br />
          Websites rely on third-party shipping companies to deliver their products. There is
          no guarantee provided that the product will arrive in usable condition.
