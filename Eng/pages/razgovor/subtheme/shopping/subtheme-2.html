          To purchase something with the promise that you will pay in the future.<br /><br />

          When buying something on credit, you acquire the item immediately, but you pay for it
          at a later date. This is a common practice that business owners us to encourage
          people to come into their stores, even people who donâ€™t actually have the money.<br /><br />

          It is a very old idea that has only grown over time, and, today, it is a common way
          to pay for anything from big purchases to small items and groceries. With the advent
          of the credit card, even those people with sufficient funds will purchase items on
          credit, and they will pay off their bill each month.<br /><br />
