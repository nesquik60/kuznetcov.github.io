          Do you feel more comfortable in smart or casual clothes?

        <p>
          Casual outfits are simply more comfortable. Wearing a business suit can weigh heavily
          after a long day, especially considering that most office jobs are largely sedentary.
          Swapping formal wear out for more comfortable options will mean a more relaxed and
          comfortable workforce during long days.<br /><br />

          <span>How often do you go clothes shopping? Where?</span><br />

          I buy most of my clothes from regular shops in regular markets where clothing items
          are affordable. However, when it comes to buying some special clothes for special
          occasions, I try to buy them from shopping malls where I can choose some clothes from
          a large collection of clothing items.<br /><br />

          I don’t really buy new clothes that often for myself as it usually takes a long time
          to wear them down. And, unless my clothes are worn out to make them look old, I don’t
          like to buy any clothes for myself. So, anyway, if you are asking me to be precise, I
          would say that I buy new clothes as often as twice or thrice a year unless I have a
          very good reason to buy on more occasions than that.<br /><br />

          I decide which clothes to buy largely depends on what time of the year I want to wear
          them. In other words, if I want to wear then during summer time, I would go for
          heat-resistant clothes. Similarly, if I want to wear them during winter time, I would
          buy warm clothes to keep myself warm and comfortable. I also decide which clothes to
          buy depending on whether I want to wear them casually or for some special occasions
          such as attending parties or enjoying a soccer game in the field.<br /><br />
