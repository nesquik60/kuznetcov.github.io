        <h1>What would your dream house be like? Where would it be?</h1>
        <p>
          Since you asked about my “dream house”, you’ll have to excuse me because I’m going to
          be as idealistic as possible! My dream house would be in Saint Petersburg, which is
          one of my favorite cities in Russia, and where I dream to relocate to when I settle
          down. I really want to live in loft.<br /><br />

          Loft is generally defined as a large, open space, usually without any internal walls.
          In addition to their wide-open feel, loft apartments are also characterized by high
          ceilings; exposed piping, ventilator tubes, and support beams and poles; wooden or
          concrete floors; as well as oversized, and often floor-to-ceiling, windows.<br /><br />

          A number of factors make loft apartments great to live in.<br /><br />

          First being, the open layout of these apartments enables you to unleash your
          creativity and model the interiors the way you like. Loft apartments give you the
          freedom to experiment and shuffle different sections of your living space.<br /><br />

          Secondly, the typically high ceilings of loft apartments give you a feeling of space
          and the tall vacant walls provide room for great decoration.<br /><br />

          Also, loft apartments usually have large windows that allow natural light to flood
          in. This could amazingly enhance your mood and inspire you.<br /><br />

          Moreover, it is not uncommon for loft apartments to feature exposed brick walls, and
          beams, which could be brilliantly amalgamated into the overall design to create a
          voguish feel.<br /><br />
