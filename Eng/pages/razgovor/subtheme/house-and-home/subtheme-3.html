          What does “home” mean to you? Do you relate to this answer: “Home” is where you

        <p>
          I think that home is a small world where one lives according to his own rules. It's a
          place where you feel comfort, warmth and reliability. And I believe that it's not the
          size of the place where you live that matters, but the way you feel about it. And if
          your house is not just a building for you but a place that you can call home, it
          means that you want to stay there as long as possible and it's a place you always
          want to return to.<br /><br />

          The importance of home is depicted in the languages of all nations: we say "East or
          West, home is best. Dry bread at home is better than roast meat abroad. ", the
          English say "My home is my castle." Home is a place that awakens the most pleasant
          feelings and high emotions in the soul of every person. For me there is no place like
          home.<br /><br />

          I'm sure that the home of a person is as much a reflection of his personality, as the
          clothes he wears, the food he eats, the books he reads and the friends he spends his
          time with. Home reflects the way of life and habits of its owner.<br /><br />

          I adore my home; I like to be there, because it's always filled with happiness and
          joy. After the first few minutes in our flat you can understand all the hospitality
          and friendliness of this place. Our flat is very warm and cosy, so it makes any
          person feel at home. It's the place where I wake up every morning to the refreshing
          smell of coffee from the kitchen and where every day of my life starts, that's why it
          is so important for me.<br /><br />

          My home, my sweet home... Sometimes after long journeys I return home like a baby
          that returns to its mother. I love every corner and everything in my flat. "My home
          is my fortress", it is my territory, my place where I feel good and comfortable. And
          nobody can disturb me here.
