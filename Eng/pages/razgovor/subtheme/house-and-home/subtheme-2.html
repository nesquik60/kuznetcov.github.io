        <h1>What’s the normal age to leave home in your country? Is it the same for men and women?</h1>
        <p>There is no certain age when it is normal to leave the parent’s house. The timing of a separate life may vary. Some people want to leave the parent’s home as soon as possible.<br><br>

          Moving away from home is considered a milestone in one’s life, an event that clearly marks the stepping out of childhood into maturity and designates the beginning of an independent, self-reliant life. Once you move out of your parents’ house, you will have the liberty to make your own choices and enjoy the lifestyle you’ve always wanted for yourself. It is a certain fact that after moving out of your parents’ house, you will have much more time and space available for yourself – it will be entirely up to you to use them as you find fit. When moving out of your parents’ house, you can choose a new city or a new neighborhood that will better suit your needs and preferences in terms of convenient location and available opportunities.<br><br>
          
          But not all people are ready to move out of the parents’ house. There are some reasons for it.<br><br>
          
          You will also have the responsibility to provide for your own needs, to find a way out of every difficult situation you encounter, and to create a life for yourself that is vibrant, progressive, and genuinely fulfilled.<br><br>
          
          When you move out of your parents’ home, mom and dad will no longer provide for your needs and cover your living expenses. Therefore, you will have to harness your financial management skills and find a way to pay for the rent, transportation, food, medical expenses and other needs. All these expenses quickly add up and may easily drain your living-alone budget. So, unless you already have a considerable income, you will not be able to save any money when living on your own. Even worse – you may even have a lot of trouble making the ends meet</p>
