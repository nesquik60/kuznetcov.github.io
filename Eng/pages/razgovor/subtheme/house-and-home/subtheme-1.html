          <span>Advantages of Living With Your Parents</span><br />
          <br /><br />
          <span>1) You will save money.</span><br />

          One of the biggest advantages of living with your parents is that you can save a lot
          more money. You'll save on rent, utility bills, renovations, shared grocery bills,
          and a lot more. Of course, you should be contributing to the household expenses
          (don't be a complete mooch!), but you won't have to spend as much as you would if you
          were on your own. If you have just graduated and can't find a job, if you are out of
          a job and struggling to pay your debts, or if you are facing financial problems,
          living with your parents could be the answer. Think of it as a stopgap arrangement
          until you get back on your feet.
          <br /><br />
          <span>2) You won't have to do all the housework.</span><br />

          Living in a multigenerational setting means there are a lot more hands to to the
          work. You won't have to so much housework since there will be more people to pitch in
          on all those daily chores. If you are still living with your parents, you may find
          yourself exempt from some of the more mundane tasks as your mom or dad may be doing
          them out of habit. If you are lucky, your mom may even do your laundry!
          <br /><br />
          <span>3) Someone will cook a nice meal when you can't.</span><br />

          As a working professional or a busy student, you may not always have time to fix
          yourself a homemade meal. If you were living on your own, you would probably grab
          some takeout or a quick bite the local joint, even though that's less healthy and
          more expensive than eating at home. Living with your parents usually comes with the
          added benefit of enjoying warm, home-cooked meals even when you don't have time to
          cook. Your mom might even have something on the table when you come home from work!<br><br>

          <span>Disadvantages of Living With Your Parents</span>
          <br /><br />
          <span>1) You don't have any privacy or private space.</span><br />

          Living with your parents will strip you of your space and privacy, and that can be a
          psychological burden, especially if you are used to living alone. No longer will you
          have the freedom to get out of bed and head to the kitchen in your underwear. No more
          drinking milk from the carton or playing music at odd hours. You can't even expect
          your parents not to enter your room since it belongs to them.
          <br /><br />
          <span>2) You can't call friends over or have house parties.</span><br />

          Have you always been the guy/girl at whose place friends crash every now and then?
          This will change when you move in with your parents. You'll can no longer allow your
          friends to sleep on your sofa, since the sofa is no longer yours. You can also forget
          about hosting parties. Neither a cozy get-together of your college buddies nor drinks
          with colleagues after work will be doable if you're living with mom or dad.
          <br /><br />
          <span>3) Unwelcome advice about your life.</span><br />

          Whether you move in with your mum, dad, or both, you are likely to receive all kinds
          of advice, even if you don't ask for it. From what you eat to the amount of time that
          you sleep to the number of hours you play video games... be prepared to get
          unsolicited advice (and judgment) for just about everything.
