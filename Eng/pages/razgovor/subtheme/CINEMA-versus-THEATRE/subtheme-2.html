        <h1>Educational role of cinema/theatre</h1>
        <p>
          People say that in order to evolve intellectually, you need to read books. Sure, the
          books play a crucial role in education. The readings allow us to learn more about the
          world around in more detail and from different angles, forming our individuality.
          However, the books are not the only source of brain food. Movies are not less
          instructive and also play a role in our educational formation.<br /><br />

          There is a category of special films that are directly used in education. Using
          movies for the educational purpose is beneficial, since the process of watching
          engages the visual memory centers, which are well developed in our brain, which helps
          the information to be remembered better. Visual images in films are associated with
          hearing or text. Moreover, the subtitles that are used in the foreign movies could
          help to learn languages.<br /><br />

          Speaking about the role of educational films, it is worth noting that they allow the
          audience to memorize a lot of information without any efforts. Movies are accessible,
          letting you get the knowledge easily, involving the emotional memory centers, so the
          information is remembered better and faster.<br /><br />

          The educational role of the movies could be observed in a broad and narrow sense. In
          the broadest sense, every movie can teach you something useful, and the obtained
          knowledge may relate to different aspects of life. Certainly we aren’t talking about
          some significant improving of skills like academic writing, for instance, which
          includes – term paper writing, research papers, reports and so on.<br /><br />

          But, in a narrow sense, there are educational films, which contain material that
          relates directly to the learning process. For example, a film with different
          subtitles and audio in several languages indirectly refers to the process of
          learning. These films are created in order to reach a large segment of the audience
          who speak different languages. At the same time, these films can be used to learn a
          foreign language, when necessary.<br /><br />

          There is also a category of films that have been created with the purpose of
          education only. These films mostly look like video tutorials and are intended to
          provide specific knowledge. Most training films created with a specific instruction /
          algorithm, which is used to achieve a better result. At the same time, everyone has
          the right to use the video capabilities in its sole discretion, and form their own
          learning process.
