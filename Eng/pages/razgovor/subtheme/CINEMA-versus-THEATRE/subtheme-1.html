        <h1>Which do you prefer: cinema or theatre</h1>
        <p>
          Perhaps it would be possible to divide all the people into two kinds: those who is
          fond of theatre and those who prefer cinema. Though these two genres have something
          in common, there’s no less difference between them. As for me, I’m definitely a
          cinema-lover, but I don’t mind going to the theatre as well. Of course, it’s only my
          subjective opinion, and it doesn’t claim to be the absolute truth, by no means.
          Cinema and Theatre have totally different means to convey emotions. In Theatre, in
          order that all the spectators should hear, understand and feel deeply everything
          going on onstage, actors have to increase considerably the degree of emotions.
          Besides, due to the lack of other means (such as fast change of a background, for
          example, and many others), all of the spectator’s attention is upon the actors. So,
          they have to be very active, laud, mobile, their gestures must be expressive, in
          order to hold the spectator’s attention. For example, to convey the deep sorrow of a
          character, in cinema it may be enough to make a close shot of the actor’s eyes, or
          maybe to show his dark silhouette against the window with heavy rain going there (or
          something like that), to accompany the scene with the appropriate music, and so on.
          But to convey the same feeling onstage, the actor would fall on his knees, wring his
          hands, maybe scream at the top of his voice For example, to convey the deep sorrow of

          in everything going on there. I don’t see the actors, I see the characters, and I
          sincerely empathize them.
