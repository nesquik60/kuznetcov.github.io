          <span>Living abroad:</span><br />

          Moving to a foreign country is the most intense way of getting to know a different
          culture. It is an immersive experience where you step out of the comfort zone of your
          home and dive into new customs, habits and language. It might sound overwhelming at
          first, so let’s start with the best things this experience overseas might bring.<br /><br />

          <span>Pros of living abroad</span><br /><br />

          <span>Explore a different culture</span><br />

          When moving to a foreign country, you will most likely be inserted in a place that is
          culturally very different from what you are used to. This can be seen in several
          ways: the architecture of the buildings, the way that people interact with each other
          or even social gatherings. Enjoy this opportunity to really get to know and embrace
          this new environment with all it has to offer.<br /><br />

          <span>Meet new people</span><br />

          Even though in the beginning it may seem difficult to make new friends, this is one
          of the greatest advantages of living abroad. While at home, it is easy to often find
          yourself surrounded by likeminded people (and there is nothing wrong about that),
          moving to a different country is the perfect opportunity to open up your mind and
          talk to people who have different ideas and life stories. Try using this experience
          abroad to connect with locals and other expats. Taking gym classes, signing up for
          events of the student union or hanging out with co-workers are great ways of getting
          started. Maybe in the end you will end up having friends from all over the world.<br /><br />

          <span>Building up your soft skills</span><br />

          Having an experience of living abroad can be very useful when looking for a job. Most
          companies value international experiences, even if they were for leisure or study.
          When a person steps out of their comfort zone and moves to another country, there is
          always an improvement in their communication skills, social skills and networking.
          You also learn how to relate to people from different cultural backgrounds and
          respect divergent opinions. These are all highly valuable attributes in a work
          environment.<br /><br />

          <span>Cons of living abroad</span><br />

          When someone moves to a new country, the first few months can be considered as an
          adaptation period. This is when people face most of the challenges of living abroad.
          In order to help with the transition, here are a few tips on how to make the best of
          each situation.<br /><br />

          <span>Financial challenges of living abroad</span><br />

          Finances is always a big topic when it comes to the disadvantages of living abroad,
          especially for people who move to a new country for work purposes. After moving, you
          need to become familiar with a totally new financial system. Some things to be aware
          of are currency conversions (if applicable), how the tax system works and what
          paperwork you need to arrange.<br />

          Overall, living abroad is a very rewarding experience and you will come back to your
          loved ones filled with new adventures and stories to tell.<br />
