          <span>Pros:</span><br /><br />

          • You realise that people are nicer and kinder than you expected. People will not
          only pick you up, they will sometimes feed you, give you water, they will sometimes
          take you straight to the address. Sometimes they will even make an 80 km (50 miles)
          detour to take you wherever you need to go. Truck drivers will make a wrong turn on
          purpose, just to drop you off somewhere closer to the city. Sometimes they will offer
          you their couch. You'll get rid of your prejudice.<br /><br>

          • You'll get to learn/improve the local language, because the drivers sometimes don't
          speak English or any other language you speak. Language also provides a good insight
          in the local culture and helps you get by.<br /><br>

          • You don't need to book flights, reserve seats. You can leave whenever you want in
          whatever direction you want. You have a more flexible schedule, and if you meet
          someone along the way, your trip can go in an opposite direction. If you combine it
          with hospitality websites, such as CouchSurfing, the sense of freedom rises even
          more.<br /><br>

          • It develops your orientation skills, map reading and makes you more independent.<br /><br />

          <span>Cons</span><br />

          • If you're hitchhiking for a long time, you can get tired of saying the same old
          story about your hitchhiking trip. It might become boring.<br /><br>

          • It's hard to maintain a healthy diet when on the road, but it can be achieved.<br /><br>

          • You have to maintain a conversation even if you are tired and just want to sleep.
          In the culture of hitchhiking, it's a big faux pas to fall asleep as soon as you get
          in the vehicle.<br /><br />

          <span>THE BENEFITS OF CAMPING</span><br /><br />

          <span>Pros:</span><br />

          1. It’s cheap and cheerful.<br />

          2. Being back to nature and not feeling tied to technology.<br />

          3. Being woken up by the sun and heading to bed as soon it gets dark – the perfect
          way to reset your body clock.<br />

          4. Having a BBQ for breakfast.<br />

          5. Watching the kids play outside all day without ever once asking for their iPad or
          your phone – usually because the battery flats but at least they’re not looking for
          it!<br /><br />

          <span>Cons:</span><br />

          1. Sleeping in a tent as the rain pelts down outside.<br />

          2. Being eaten alive by bugs – but at least that means the weather is good.<br />

          3. Having to share a shower with the other campers.<br />

          4. Bringing the kids to the toilet at 3am when it’s pitch dark outside!<br />

          5. Setting up the tent with an overly enthusiastic five-year-old. <br />

          <span>Active holiday and weather</span><br /><br />

          <span>1. Challenge yourself</span><br />

          A great reason to take on an adventure holiday is to get yourself out of your comfort
          zone and see how far you can really go.

          <span>2.Incredible experiences</span><br /><br />

          <span>Winter:</span><br />

          Sheregesh offers a range of choices for enjoying vacations customized to what you
          desire, whether you're looking for adventure, relaxation, or a little of both: there
          is a bowling centre, an indoor ice rink, a tennis court, entertainment centers, and
          even «the upside down house», an attraction where all things are fastened to the
          ceiling for unusual photoshoots.
