          <span>Haifa</span><br />

          Haifa has a variety of different neighborhoods and a mix of cultures, making it a
          very lively place to visitor. Tourists can enjoy the beautiful port and the vibrant
          beach, perfect for surfers. Plus, they can take in the beautiful nature Haifa has to
          offer with its unique Bahai Garden.<br /><br />

          <span>Tel Aviv</span><br />

          Tel Aviv combines relaxing beaches, a vibrant nightlife, authentic markets, culinary
          delights and much more. The diverse society is very open-minded, so everyone will be
          able to find their place here. As Israel’s center of entertainment, Tel Aviv also
          offers a full calendar of events throughout the year. These include the Gay Pride
          Parade, Purim Street Party and Tel Aviv Fashion Week.<br /><br />

          <span>Dead Sea</span><br />

          The lowest point on earth, at more than 430 meters (1,412 feet) below the sea level,
          the Dead Sea is not only fun to float in, it is also healthy, historic and surrounded
          by breathtaking beauty. This endorheic lake is one of the saltiest bodies of water on
          Earth, giving it the perfect buoyancy for floating. Plus you can cover your body in
          the healthy Dead Sea mud to find pure, inner relaxation. Once in the Dead Sea area,
          there are two other sites that should not be missed: Masada, with its archaeological
          importance and amazing views, and Ein Gedi, a water oasis in the desert.<br /><br />

          The cost of living in Israel varies depending on where in the country an expat
          decides to settle and what type of lifestyle they aspire to. Urban centres are more
          expensive than desert outposts or mountain towns. Tel Aviv, Israel's most
          cosmopolitan destination claiming a cost of living higher than both Paris and London.
          The cost of accommodation in Israel varies depending on location, but this will
          certainly be an expat's largest expense.
