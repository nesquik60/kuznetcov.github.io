        <p>
          Exercise benefits every part of the body, including the mind. Exercising causes the
          body to make chemicals that can help a person feel good. Exercise can help people
          sleep better. It can also help some people who have mild depression and low
          self-esteem. Plus, exercise can give people a real sense of accomplishment and pride
          at having achieved a goal — like beating an old time in the 100-meter dash.<br /><br />
          Exercise helps people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases. Exercising
          regularly lowers a person's risk of developing some diseases, including obesity, type
          2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Exercise also can help keep your body at a
          healthy weight.<br /><br />
          Exercise can help a person age well. This may not seem important now, but your body
          will thank you later. For example, osteoporosis (a weakening of the bones) can be a
          problem as people get older. Weight-bearing exercise — like jumping, running, or
          brisk walking — can help keep bones strong.
