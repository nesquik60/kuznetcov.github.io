          Personally, I believe that professional sport is very dangerous and difficult to be
          superposed with good health education and communication with friends. Firstly,
          professional sport is very risky, as you can hurt your body and be injured at your
          regular trainings or championships. Secondly, this sport takes too much of your free
          time and it is really hard to combine your studies and companionship with preparing
          and participating in sports competitions. However, some people will not agree with
          me. They claim that both professional sport and amateur one always means suffering
          injuries. Besides, professional sportsmen constantly socialize with their coaches and
          teammates. Moreover, taking into consideration education, professional sport makes
          people organized and self-disciplined and motivates them to get education.
