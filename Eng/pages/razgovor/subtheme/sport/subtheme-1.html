        <h1>The reasons people go in for sport</h1>
        <p>
          There are many people who do sports for nothing around us. Every day we can encounter
          with these people. They regularly do sports; however, none of them realizes the
          benefits and importance of sports. In fact, for example, some people want to be fit
          and attractive, look smart. Unfortunately, these people canâ€™t consider other benefits
          of sports. In my opinion, there are several benefits of sports that people often do
          not consider: sports are required to be healthy people, are needed for enjoyment, and
          are great way of building a healthy and strong character. The value of both
          professional and amateur sport lays not only the body but also the mind. Almost every
          game requires a certain degree of skill to play. Skill is a mental quality. Physical
          attributes alone are not enough in games like golf, cricket and tennis. Sports
          develop and encourage the spirit of healthy competition and it`s also has wide scope
          for the competitive instinct. Matches, tournaments and contests are held to test our
          skills, toughness, stamina and endurance of values of participants.
