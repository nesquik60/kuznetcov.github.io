          <span> 1. Exercise Daily</span><br />

          Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running,
          jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your
          everyday life.<br /><br />

          <span>2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal</span><br />

          No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try
          to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if
          it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and
          vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do
          a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables
          such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running.<br /><br />

          <span> 3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day</span> <br />

          Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out
          your physical exercising.<br /><br />

          <span> 4. Be Sure to Get Sleep</span> <br />

          Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you
          happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a
          small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will
          prevent you from staying up later in the night.<br /><br />

          <span> 5. Stay Motivated</span> <br />

          An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If
          you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've
          always wanted.
