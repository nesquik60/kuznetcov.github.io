          <span>Fitness is an important part of our overall health for many reasons:</span>
          <br />

          1. Being physically fit helps to keep blood pressure under control. The heart is a
          muscle and if it is not exercised it will not be healthy. When you are fit, your
          heart is less likely to develop the many heart diseases found in so many people
          today. Walking is said to be the ultimate way to remain fit, with 2000 steps per day
          great for exercising the heart and keeping those joints supple.<br /><br />

          2. Talking of joints, exercise – fitness – is good for anyone with arthritis or stiff
          muscles. Gentle exercise from walking or swimming helps to strengthen the muscles,
          joints and ligaments so that the range of motion is maintained or even increased. 3.
          Being fit is caused by physical activity, but such exercise also makes us healthier
          emotionally. It gives us a sense of purpose and reduces feelings of lethargy and
          depression. When you get out and about on your walk you will see or meet other people
          and this social interaction is also necessary to keep you feeling good about yourself
          and your life.<br /><br />

          4. Being fit means you will not be overweight – or at least, not as much as those
          people who never exercise. Being overweight causes a lot of problems, from worn
          joints to heart disease and many problems in between, as well as making you feel bad
          about your body image. When you are fit and healthy, you will always be more
          confident and happier as you tend to seek out people and activities that help you
          enjoy life.
