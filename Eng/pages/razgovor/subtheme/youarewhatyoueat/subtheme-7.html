        <h1>Modern day families prefer to eat-out</h1>
        <p>
          Nowadays, some people like to eat at home and prepare food by themselves, but others
          prefer to eat outside in restaurants. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to eat at
          home. Of course, there are some advantages to eat out. Firstly, restaurants offer a
          more comfortable environment to eat and the food there tastes more delicious than
          home-cooked meals. In addition, eating at restaurants is a good way of getting
          together with friends. People also do not need to worry about washing dishes and
          cleaning. For people who are too busy to cook, eating out is certainly an ideal
          choice. Furthermore, for people who do not know how to cook and do not have someone
          to cook for them, eat out seems to be the only choice.
