        <p>
          Well, it’s important to note that mood can be influenced by many factors, such as stress, environment, poor sleep, genetics, mood disorders etc. And when you’re feeling down, it can be tempting to turn to food to lift your spirits. However, the sugary, high calorie treats that many people would eat in order to raise their mood and make them feel better right now, the long-term effects of poor quality foods as part of an everyday diet are less comforting. There can be some consequences like getting extra weight and terrible health problems. But in my opinion sometimes we can eat whatever we want if it makes us feel better spiritually. Everything is possible but in moderation and within reasonable limits.
