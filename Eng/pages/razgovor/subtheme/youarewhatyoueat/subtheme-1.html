        <h1>Home cooked meals versus junk food and snacks</h1>
        <p>
          With our busy lives, we might find it easier and faster to grab some junk food or
          snacks on our way from university or work to home. But this convenience has a price.
          Actually, scientists think that homemade meals tend to be healthier than takeaway.
          You can spare yourself unwanted calories, carbs, saturated fat and sodium by
          preparing your own meals with fresh, healthy ingredients, and possibly reducing your
          risk of getting some kind of unpleasant diseases. There have been many movies and
          documentaries that have outlined the unhealthy qualities of junk food. It’s also much
          easier to put together healthy meals when you have 100% control over the ingredients
          you’re using. For as much as fast food restaurants try to be open about their
          ingredients and their cooking methods, it’s difficult to keep track of it all or
          verify their statements in any way. But in my opinion sometimes we can eat whatever
          we want if it makes us feel better spiritually. Everything is possible but in
          moderation and within reasonable limits
