But come to think of it, is that all it takes to be perfectly healthy? Think again. There is a factor as important, that you may have been ruling out unknowingly. We’re talking about meal timings. Remember how in school you had a fixed lunch break and each day the bell would ring at the same time? Turns out that this is the kind of discipline your body asks for, (in addition to good food of course) to be healthy. The time at which you take your meals, the intervals at which you take your meals are a significant part of your diet and cannot be ruled out. consuming your meals and snacks on a regular schedule can help keep your digestive system in top shape.” When you don’t eat at consistent times each day, it can cause your stomach to overwork resulting in bloating and indigestion, but eating on a schedule “will allow proper digestion of your food, which will result in you having a good comfortable feeling in your stomach. The key is to eat every 3 to 4 hours in order to allow your stomach to properly digest its contents. By setting specific times for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks and sitting down to eat them at the same time each day, your body knows exactly when it’s time to eat, which will help prevent overeating and improve digestive health.
