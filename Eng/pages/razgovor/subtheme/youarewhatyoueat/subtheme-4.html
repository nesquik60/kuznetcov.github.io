        <p>
          We all know that exercise is important in our daily lives. Our bodies are designed
          and have evolved to be regularly active. There are many benefits of regular exercise
          and maintaining fitness and these include: increasing energy levels, improving muscle
          strength, helping you to maintain a healthy weight, improving brain function,
          enhancing your immune system, improving your mood etc. Getting fit is not just about
          running on a treadmill for hours in your local gym, it can be a dance class or a new
          hobby like mountain biking. It could be a group or team activity like football or a
          karate class. Whatever form of exercise you choose, youâ€™ll almost certainly meet new
          people and may make new friends. But you cannot merely exercise and expect your body
          to stay fit. A balanced diet is also essential for that.
