        <h1>Fast food versus home cooked meals</h1>
        <p>
          With our busy lives, we might find it easier and faster to grab some fast food on our
          way from university or work to home. But this convenience has a price. Actually,
          scientists think that homemade meals tend to be healthier than takeaway. You can
          spare yourself unwanted calories, carbs, saturated fat and sodium by preparing your
          own meals with fresh, healthy ingredients, and possibly reducing your risk of getting
          some kind of unpleasant diseases. There have been many movies and documentaries that
          have outlined the unhealthy qualities of fast food. It’s also much easier to put
          together healthy meals when you have 100% control over the ingredients you’re using.
          For as much as fast food restaurants try to be open about their ingredients and their
          cooking methods, it’s difficult to keep track of it all or verify their statements in
          any way. But in my opinion sometimes we can eat whatever we want if it makes us feel
          better spiritually. Everything is possible but in moderation and within reasonable
          limits.
