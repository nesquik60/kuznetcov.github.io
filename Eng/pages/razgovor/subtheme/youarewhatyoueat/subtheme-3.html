        <h1>Diets</h1>
        <p>
          Healthy eating protects you against many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet. A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. These include: Staples like cereals; Fruit and vegetables; Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk) etc. Nowadays the trend of junk food is here to stay. People are not taking a balanced diet rather eating all sorts of harmful foods. It is more important than ever to tell people about the importance of a balanced diet. You cannot merely exercise and expect your body to stay fit. A balanced diet is crucial for that.
