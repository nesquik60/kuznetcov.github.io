        <h1>Your impression of heavy metal</h1>
        <p>
          We can hear music everywhere: in the streets and at home, over the radio and on TV,
          in the shops and in the parks. People all over the world are fond of music. There are
          a variety of different musical genres exists. As for heavy metal, actually, I donâ€™t
          really like that kind of music I find it noisy and dreadful. When I listen to this
          style of music it presents to my mind pictures of dark days. Though some young people
          are fond of this style of music, it is not to everyone's taste. To my mind, music too
          loud can destroy our ears. But I am indifferent to other styles of rock music.
