          Do you prefer classical music to pop music? Why? (Are you for or against classical
          music? Give your arguments.)

          Well. Classical music is complicated and different from popular music, but that
          doesn't make it better to everyone. Classical uses no words. It has a deep effect by
          composition alone. Add opera and the feel is quite different.<br /><br />

          Popular music relies more on lyrics, depending on the genre and particular song.
          There are musicals, instrumental, lots of beautiful soundtrack pieces that are no
          less complex or beautiful than classical.<br /><br />

          New age is updated from classical, combining more current feel with some feel of the
          classics, as is possible.<br /><br />

          You can be a purist or you can enjoy everything you like that moves you. Music, with
          words or not, is about expression and connection. Just enjoy and appreciate all of
          it.
