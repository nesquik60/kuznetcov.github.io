          The biggest mistake most people make is thinking they always know what's best for their kid.
          I believe that all parents want success for their kids; and I believe that they should encourage their children (rather than push) to follow their dreams and progress their skills and interests.<br><br>
          Parents need to remember: your child is an independent person with their own hopes, dreams, and wants in life. They are not someone for you to push your regrets and desires on. They are not a miniature version of you that should follow your exact path (or avoid the life-choices youâ€™re unhappy with). They are their own person, and want to pursue their own goals.<br><br>
          So be supportive and push them towards success, when they have a firm grasp of what they want out of life. If they come to you with a career idea, be supportive! Ask how they want to approach this dream, how they'll make it a reality.<br><br>
          Trying to force on them a life that they don't want to lead will cause resentment and rebellious behavior, rather than love, bonding, and success.<br><br>
          A clear example of it is the childhood of Mozart. Leopold with the patience of a teacher raised a musician in his son. He taught Wolfgang to play the violin, harpsichord and organ, seriously studied musical composition with him, as well as arithmetic, history and geography, Latin and Italian. But most importantly, Leopold Mozart showed his son how music is born in the soul, and helped the boy not to disturb himself from being a musician.
