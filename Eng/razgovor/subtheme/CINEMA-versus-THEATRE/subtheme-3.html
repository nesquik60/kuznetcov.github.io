          When I watched the movie “Titanic” for the first time almost twenty years ago, I was
          pretty much occupied with the tragic love story of two teenagers who met on the
          biggest ship yet on the earth in 1912. But when I saw the movie once again before
          about 10 years, I was actually more interested in finding the “Titanic” ship itself
          and its historical relevance in today’s world. So, if one asks me today why I watched
          the movie, I would simply say that it perfectly and very boldly portrayed the
          “demise” of a group of people who thought that they were simply “invincible” and
          “indestructible” under even the worst of the circumstances.<br /><br />

          Having a dominant theme of the power of love to thrive in every situation, the
          “Titanic”, as one of the greatest movies of all time with 11 academy awards under its
          name, has tried to reveal that a man can find love in any kind of situation and from
          any woman in spite of their agonizingly different socio-economic classes. But, of
          course, their dramatic love had ended when the allegedly ‘unsinkable’ ship, with 2200
          people on board including the two love bugs, was drowned unexpectedly after hitting
          the iceberg and thus killing 1500 people.<br /><br />

          This is one of my most favourite movies of all time simply because every aspect of
          the movie, whether it is with the casting or scene selection, everything has been
          done so flawlessly for its theme to come out perfectly and clearly. This film was
          written, directed, co-produced and co-edited by James Cameron, who is one of the most
          talented movie-makers in the world. Big movie starts, like Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate
          Winslet, Gloria Stuart and Bill Paxton made it worth enjoying. Interestingly, the
          film includes portrayals of several historical figures which makes it more
          fascinating and enlightening.<br /><br />

          Besides, in my opinion, very few movies have managed to inspire so much emotion as
          Titanic. Having reconstituted such a mesmerizing historic event in such an aesthetic
          fashion, the soundtrack of this movie is simply outstanding. Then, there is, of
          course, finally the sinking part of the ship which just looked too surreal for
          anyone’s imagination.<br /><br />
