          <span>Benefits of Cosmetic Surgery:</span><br />

          <span>• Enhanced Appearance</span><br />

          The first and main benefit of cosmetic surgery is that it helps to align your natural
          appearance with your desired appearance. If you want to undergo cosmetic surgery,
          it’s reasonable to assume that you are unhappy with some aspect(s) of your
          appearance, and you desperately want to change it. Once you do it, your appearance
          will change forever – resulting in an improved version of yourself.<br /><br />

          <span>• Improved Confidence</span><br />

          By fixing and altering your appearance to suit your wishes, you will automatically
          have an improved self-esteem. This does wonders for your social life and your mental
          health. Being confident in the way you look makes you feel better in all aspects of
          life.<br /><br />

          <span>• Permanent Results</span><br />

          Another key advantage to cosmetic surgery is that it produces results which often
          last a long time or are permanent.<br><br>

          <span>Disadvantages of Cosmetic Surgery:</span><br />

          <span>• Doesn’t Always Meet Expectations</span><br />

          The disadvantage of cosmetic surgery is that after the procedure, it’s not fully
          guaranteed that you will come out of the other end completely satisfied with the
          changes.<br /><br />

          <span>• Recovery Time</span><br />

          Another unfavourable factor that you should bear in mind is that, after surgery, the
          recovery period can last quite a long time.
