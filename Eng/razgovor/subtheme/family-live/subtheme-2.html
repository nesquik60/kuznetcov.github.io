        <p>
          Working with family comes with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. One
          major advantage is trusting and really knowing your business partners.<br /><br />

           <span>Advantages of family businesses</span> 
          <span>1. Common values</span> - you and your family are likely to
          share the same ethos and beliefs on how things should be done. This will give you an
          extra sense of purpose and pride - and a competitive edge for your business.<br /><br />

          <span>2. Strong commitment</span> - building a lasting family enterprise means you're more likely
          to put in the extra hours and effort needed to make it a success. Your family is more
          likely to understand that you need to take a more flexible approach to your working
          hours.<br /><br />

          <span>3. Loyalty</span> - strong personal bonds mean you and family members are likely to stick
          together in hard times and show the determination needed for business success.<br /><br />

          <span>4. Stability</span> - knowing you're building for future generations encourages the
          long-term thinking needed for growth and success - though it can also produce a
          potentially damaging inability to react to change.<br /><br />

          <span>5. Decreased costs</span> - family members may be more willing to make financial sacrifices
          for the sake of the business. For example, accepting lower pay than they would get
          elsewhere to help the business in the longer term, or deferring wages during a
          cashflow crisis. You may also find you don't need employers' liability insurance if
          you only employ close family members.<br /><br />

          <span>6.</span> Family members could cover you in case of emergency or absence for nothing.<br /><br /><br>

          <span>Disadvantages of family businesses</span><br />

          <span>1. Lack of skills or experience </span>– some family businesses will appoint family members
          into roles that they do not have the skills or training for. This can have a negative
          effect on the success of the business and lead to a stressful working environment.
          And it will be very difficult to hire someone else to his job.<br /><br />

          <span>2. Family conflict</span> – conflict can arise in any business, but it’s important to
          consider that disputes within a family business can become personal as the staff are
          working with the people closest to them. Bad feelings and resentment could
          destabilise the business' operations and put your family relations at risk.<br /><br />

          <span>3. Favouritism</span> - can you be objective when promoting staff and only promote the best
          person for the job whether they are a relative or not? It is important to make
          business decisions for business reasons, rather than personal ones. This can
          sometimes be difficult if family members are involved.<br /><br />

          <span>4. Succession planning</span> – many family business owners may find it difficult to decide
          who will be in charge of the business if they were to step down. The leader must
          determine objectively who can best take the business forward and aim to reduce the
          potential for future conflict - this can be a daunting decision.<br /><br />

          <span>5.</span> Emotional and social considerations Will be a challenge, where you should separate
          them from business strategies.<br /><br />

          <span>6.</span> Second generation conflicts and politics, mostly it is better to move the business
          to the next level and to be on the stock market, where each share holder is free to
          sell his shares whenever he want.<br /><br />
