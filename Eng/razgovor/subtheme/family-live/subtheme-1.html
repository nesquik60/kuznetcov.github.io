          Conflicts between parents and teens are nothing new.<br /><br />

          Teens are striving to find independence anyway they can. From fashion to activities,
          teens want to control their lives. Since teens are trying to learn how to be an adult
          and navigate the world without parental supervision, this is a common problem. To
          help keep balance in relationships, you should talk with teens and try to understand
          why they choose the music, cloths or activities they do. Set limits that still allow
          teens to express themselves in safe ways like dying their hair blue.<br /><br />

          Going along with asserting their independence, teens are ready to prove their point.
          Whether they are told they can't go out today or they need to do their homework,
          adolescents are ready to argue. Not only do they want to discuss a perceived
          injustice, but many times they feel parents don't trust them. Rather than arguing, it
          is important to listen to your teen. In a calm voice, try to understand the point
          that teens are trying to make and work to compromise rather than argue.<br /><br />

          Many times, it feels like parents and teens are on two different planets or speaking
          two different languages. Phrases like "you don't understand," or "it's like you don't
          even listen to me," are phrases parents hear over and over. Teens don't feel that
          parents listen to them or understand their feelings. To wander through the murky
          water of communication, it's important to listen to teens. Rather than blasting
          questions at them, make general conversation and listen to what they have to say. It
          is also important to validate their feelings. Rather than just saying, "no" listen to
          why they broke their curfew or want to attend that party.<br /><br />
