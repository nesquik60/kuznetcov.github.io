          Talk about the most important things in your life:
          • financial security<br />

          • good health<br />

          • family life<br />

          • career<br />

          • friendship<br /><br />

          Financial security means being economically stable and having enough money saved to
          cover emergencies and future financial goals. Money plays a huge role in the society
          in variety of ways such as in business, at peoples job, and even in education. Money
          helps people achieve a better quality of education, larger chance of business
          success, and higher work output. Money is important because having money means that
          you will not be destitute. It means that you are not dependent on being employed,
          living paycheck to paycheck, and having to put up with abuse by your boss because you
          badly need your job. Money is important because it enables you to have more control
          over your life, more freedom to carve out your own path, and fewer constraints on
          your choices. Money is important because it means being able to give your children
          the best – the best education, the best health care, the best start in life.<br /><br />

          Your health is at the center of your life. Every part of your life relies on you
          having good health. You cannot climb higher in all the other seven areas of your life
          if you do not have enough physical energy to devote to each of them. When you have
          low energy, it is difficult to:<br /><br>

          • express love and intimacy<br />

          • support your family and consciously parent your children<br />

          • perform at work if you are too tired to be productive<br />

          • have fun with friends if you are dull and lethargic<br />

          • learn and grow if your weak body has weakened your mind<br />

          • have a sense of charity and contribution if ill health has you looking inwards
          rather than outwards on helping others.<br /><br />

          Without good health, you have nothing!<br />

          1. Family is the most important and valuable gift that god has given me. It is the
          first lesson in relationships with others. Family is really an important word. It
          means to feel secure, to have someone who you can count on, whom you can share your
          problems with. But it also means to have respect for each other and
          responsibility.<br /><br />

          2. I think career is important because<br />

          • People will respect you.<br />

          • Your self-confidence will boost up.<br />

          • You will have goal and aim for yourself which will keep you focussed.<br />

          • Level of maturity and vision for life will change.<br />

          • Good career is directly proportional to healthy wealthy life and a reason for
          happiness.<br />

          • And of course if career is good one will be able to keep their family and loved
          ones happy.<br /><br />

          But yes before career there always comes a happiness of themselves. If one has to
          choose between career and other thing at certain point of time, one should relate
          themself with it and choose what makes him happy. Because at the end life is a
          journey and career is a path. One has to find it's own path. 3. Just like family,
          friends are a vital part of our existence and happiness. They are people that can
          share the best parts of your life with you and will be there as a confidant when you
          need to talk about personal issues. While real friends are hard to come by, most will
          have a handful of trusted friends that they can rely on. And even though you may
          outgrow certain friends during different stages of your life, you will have
          opportunities to form new relationships with people that you come across.<br /><br />
