        <h1>What kind of painting do you prefer? Why?</h1>
        <p>
          I am truly, completely attracted towards abstract art. I would anytime prefer
          abstract art over realism. Prefer as in, I would first learn, study and try to gain
          mastery over abstract art before going for realism. Not that I dislike realism, but
          it's the abstract paintings which are more captivating for me.<br /><br />

          <span>Why do I prefer abstract art?</span><br />

          Abstract paintings are all about the game of colours. I get an adrenaline rush
          whenever I look at colours. Abstracts are about creating something which is
          aesthetically good, visually pleasing just out colours, strokes, shapes may be and
          textures. There is no definite subject, no definite/fixed message. Although there has
          to be a firm foundation of shapes/colours to create a good piece of abstract art.
          According to me, to create something visually pleasing just out of colours and
          textures in a limited time is a lot more difficult than spending ample amount of time
          on detailing as in realism. I don't intend to say that realism is easy. It's just
          that more emphasis is on technique and minute detailing. Realism is good in it's own
          way.
